Basic traversal for tree need stack and queue which are very large.

It is difficult to find successor node for a given node.

do not need both stacks and queues and such traversal algorithm called Threaded Binaray Tree Traversals

consider node k has right child r. then its left pointer of r must be either has a child or has a Thread back to k.

if left subtree is empty, left link points to the in-order predecessor. 
if right subtree is empty, right link points to the in-order successor.
