Basic Introduction:

I love coding, so I choose to be a software engineer. My passion starts from my first project of building a web project. The first time, I start to feel the achivement made by me. 

For education aspect, Currently, I am a graduate student in Johns Hopkins. I have taken several courses: for example -- algorithms, parallel programming, object-oriented programming, database and so on. I also have a solid math and electrical engineering backgroud. 

My most proficient language is Java. And I am able to do objected-oriented design and implementation. Have experience in Web developement, have used
wordpress, drupal to manage web contents. Also have plenty experience in building mobile apps: last semester, I am responsible for the backend of the an android application. An awesome project. Great idea to connect people with same travel interest. I have applied Hibernate framework which is Object-Relational Mapping tool, in the backend.  Also we have used several objected oriented design pattern in the backend to make the project more extensible and closed for modification. As for the source control, we have used Git to control the version. Also, done lots of JUit test. Though it is still under-developed. But I have learned lot from this proejct.

Also in some web projects, I have experience in using AngularJS in the font-end.

As for open source technology, i have experience in Hadoop, map/reduce. For web development, I also have experience in Node.js.

For personality, I am a teammaker, good communicator. Rather than push my team mates to work on projects, I'd like motivate them on it.
So, yeah, that's me.
