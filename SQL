SQL is based on set and relational operation.

allows duplicates in relations as well as in query results. 
to avoid duplicates, insert keyword----> distinct

to keep duplicates, --> all

rename---> ** as **     -----> different representation for output
and also can simplify

String operation----> %-> match any substring    _ --> match any char

union ,,, intersect

avg, min, max, sum, count

procedure ---> a group of PL/SQL statements that we call by name.
