1. change permission
chmod 400 file  ---> read by owner
chmod 040 file ---> read by group
chmod 004 file --> read by world

chmod 200 file --> write by owner

chmod +rx file --> give owner read and execute permission

2. Comment:
#---> if in a quote or using escaping, it is not working as a Comment

; --> command separator   --> permits puting two or more commands on the same line.

;; --> case option--> case "$variable" in
                        abs) echo "\$variable = abc" ;;
                        xyz) echo "\variable = xyz" ;;
                      esac

. --> a single dot represent the current directory; double dot represent the parent directory;

-- double dash--> used for end of command options
for example--> grep -v file --> means that find out the lines that does not contains. to get lines contains -v: grep -- -v file

` ---> command substitution--> a = `ls`;echo $a







-----------------------------------
Variable and Parameters:

distinguish name and its value --> for example : a = 9;echo a;echo $a
echo "$a", double quoting does not interfere with variable substitution
exit 0--> denote end of sh script
for loop in bash--->
        for i in 7 8 9
        do 
            echo "$i "
        done
